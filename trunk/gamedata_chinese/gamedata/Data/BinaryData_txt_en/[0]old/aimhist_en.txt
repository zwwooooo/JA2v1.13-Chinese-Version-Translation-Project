In the Beginning

5600:
In a Montreal subterranean bunker in 1991, three men, known only by their aliases Colonel Mohanned, Commander Spice and The White Asian, found themselves in the heat of an armed struggle without access to enough manpower to end the hostilities. With great effort, they secured financing and located the people they needed to put an end to the conflict.

6400:
The underground channels they developed became known as the Association of International Mercenaries. Vowing that others seeking justice should have access to professional soldiers, their assembled team of men and women became the original members of A.I.M. Commanders engaged in small scale, private conflicts adopted the organization as a prime resource for labor.

The Island of Metavira

8000:
Operating in the shadows of military warfare, the organization finallly gained worldwide recognition when they brought the Metavira conflict to a successful end. It was a hard-fought, island based engagement that sacrificed many lives. Yet, it resulted in securing a steady supply of medically rare and valuable fallow sap.

Gus Tarballs

10400:
A year later, governments around the world called upon A.I.M. when the DFK tried to monopolize the skies with its satellite technology. Gus Tarballs commanded the A.I.M. operative excursion that brought the DFK to their knees.

11200:
The operation proved, beyond a doubt, how crucial private, limited-scale, tactical warfare can be. As a result, A.I.M. became the model organization to call upon for such missions. The bravery and tenacity he exhibited during the battle against the DFK earned Gus Tarballs membership within A.I.M...

16000:
"If history has shown us anything, it is that war and conflict are as sure as the sun and rain. A.I.M. Inc. has a proven track record of prospering from the human condition. We see no reason why that trend should not continue well into the foreseeable future... highly recommended as a short or long-term investment."
